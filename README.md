# twitch-platform-filter
Filter Twitch games by nearly any platform.

Currently, it only offers a CLI interface. It allows adding a platform and requesting a JSON file with all the active Twitch games that run on that platform.

To use it, you'll need an API key from GiantBomb and Twitch Developers.
